React app created using the typescript template to manage the features

It has the code following these rules.

 Rules
● Toggles either sit in a group or their own
● They can sometimes have an additional input such as numeric dropdowns against the
toggle
● Some features have a parent child relationship e.g. users > users add
● If a parent toggle is enabled, the child toggles should be expanded and displayed
providing the ability to toggle them off/on
● If a parent toggle is disabled, the child toggles should be disabled and then collapsed
Completing the task
● Use TypeScript
● A dynamic schema should be provided to drive the form. The input wording and
response should not be hardcoded into the UI
● It doesn't have to fully reflect the UI; this task should give us a sense of your coding
style and an insight into how you would structure a react app
● This can run on ReactDOM.render() on a single page for demo purposes
